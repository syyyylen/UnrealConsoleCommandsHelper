![alt text](https://github.com/syyyylen/UnrealConsoleCommandsHelper/blob/main/UnrealProject/Plugins/ConsoleCommandsHelper/Resources/MainWindowExample.png?raw=true)

A small Plugin to facilitate recurrent Console Commands usages in Unreal Engine 5<br />

-> Opens a Window listing Console Commands of your choice<br />
-> Execute multiple commands all at once<br />
-> Commands are saved when the editor is closed<br />
-> You can save your commands as a .txt file template<br />
-> And then load .txt template, so it's easy to have your favourites commands<br />
from one project to another, or to share it with collaborators<br />
